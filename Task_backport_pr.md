# Bookkeeping backport PRs

If the Task corresponding the `master` branch PR is part of an Activity, you could record the backports as additional Task issues in the Activity.

If the Task is [Maintenance task](Task_maintenance_documentation.md), and the backports are trivial or fairly straightforward, record the main PR and all the backport PRs as a task list in the Task issue description.

If the backports require substantial effort, the backporting could be worth of recording as an Activity, with each backport being its own Task.
