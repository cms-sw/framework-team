description: >
  An Objective has well-define deliverable, well-defined beginning and end. It is composed of one or more Aspect or Task issues.
  An Objective can optionally be part of a Category.
  A PR can be linked to an Objective if none of the contained Aspect/Task issues are not linked to any PR.

      * If you are going to work on the Category, assign it to yourself
      * After creating the Category issue
        * Create Task (or Aspect) issues as sub-issues
          * Or assign also `Task` label for this issue if the Objective contains only one Task
          * You can also use a task list in the description field as a scratchpad, and then convert the task list items to sub-issues
        * If you start to work on the Objective immediately, expand the "Framework Objectives" project on the pane on the right, and
          * Set `Status` to `In progress`
          * Assign `Quarter` as current quarter
          * Set `Began` to the date you started working on the Objective
